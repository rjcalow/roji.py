Notes on Tarkovsky’s 1979 science fiction movie, Stalker, and [[Terrain vague]].

> In Stalker, {terrain vague} becomes the material embodiment of an idea—that the world around us is, ultimately, the world we think into existence and, at the same time, the world that inhabits us. What is magical in this version of terrain vague (which, as Solà-Morales suggests, is indeed “evocative”—it “calls forth”) is that people bring their world into being, so that terrain vague, in its productive indeterminacy, becomes a tangible manifestation of an otherwise suppressed or forgotten dialogue between the human being and the physical environment. (Radović, 2013)
